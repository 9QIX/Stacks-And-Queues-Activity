# Stacks-And-Queues-Activity
Create a class called Stack for storing integers and compare it to the STL implementation of C++. Create a program which will first invoke/call Stack functions using your own implementation and then the functions from the STL Stack instance.  The data members are an integer array for storing the integers and an integer for storing the top of stack (tos). Include member functions for initializing tos to 0, pushing an element to the stack and for popping an element from the stack. The push() function should check for “stack overflow” and pop() should check for “stack underflow”.  Do the same for Queue and submit the codes and output.  observe/analyze enqueue and dequeue and write your observations about wrap around.
